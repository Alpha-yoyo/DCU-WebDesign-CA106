                <p>Hi, my name is Qiyang Zuo, I'm 18 years old. I was born in China on the 21st of July 2001. I moved to Ireland in 2009 when I was about 8 years old. Now, I'm currently a first-year student studying Computer Applications at Dublin City University. I'm also a member of Redbrick Society. Redbrick is DCU's Computer Networking society.<br> I have a huge interest in technologies since when I was a kid, I have always wanted to make something cool using programming languages. This is why I choose to study Computer Applications in DCU. I'm now one step further to achieving my dreams.</p>    <!-- add your 150 word maximum About Me content here.
